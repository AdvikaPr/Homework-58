            <h1> My Favorite Hobby:
                Reading Books</h1>
            <p> Reading is my Favorite Hobby because
                when you start reading it's like being in the story
                and there is lots of types of books like:
                Drama Books, Nonfictions Books, Fiction Books and so much more! Books have so many variety so if you don't like one type you can always try another! </p>
            <p>
                You know how video games and watch TV is very fun but you get a limited time for them, well books are as fun and your parents won't forbid you from reading books (except if the book isn't a appropriate one for you!)! </p>

            <p> Reading is a really fun thing to do when you're bored and guess what! You can read at your school
                because reading is a very common subject in schools
                so you can read all you want!
            </p>
            <p>
                These are all the reasons why my favorite hobby is reading! Thanks for reading! Bye!
            </p>
